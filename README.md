# ANPR-using-Image-Processing-and-Deep-Learning
The ANPR algorithm uses yolo to detect number plates. The cropped image of the detected number plates are then pre-processed to highlight only individual characters (numbers and alphabets). A trained CNN model then converts previously identified characters into text format.

# Outputs
1. Image of a car with visible number plate:

2. Detected Numberplate:

3. Detected Characters:

Detected number plate values in text format: TN74AH1413
